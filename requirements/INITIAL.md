markdown# Multi-Agent Coding Framework Examples

This example demonstrates a multi-turn, multi-agentic coding framework that combines:
- LangGraph for agent orchestration and workflow management
- VERL for reinforcement learning training of coding agents
- Specialized agents for code generation, review, and execution

## Architecture Overview

The system uses a supervisor pattern where LangGraph coordinates three specialized agents:
1. **Code Generator**: Creates initial code solutions
2. **Code Reviewer**: Analyzes code quality and suggests improvements  
3. **Code Executor**: Tests code and provides execution feedback

## Quick Start

1. Set up environment variables in `.env`
2. Run: `python examples/cli.py --problem "Write a function to reverse a string"`
3. Watch the agents collaborate to solve the coding problem

Technical Considerations:

Keep It Simple Initially:

Start with basic PPO training in VERL
Use simple coding problems (e.g., LeetCode easy problems)
Implement basic reward functions (code correctness + style)
Use FSDP backend for easier setup


VERL Integration Gotchas:

VERL now supports vLLM>=0.8.2 when using FSDP as the training backend
Please avoid vllm 0.7.x, which contains bugs that may lead to OOMs and unexpected errors
Use VERL's hybrid programming model for flexible RL dataflow definition
Implement proper reward functions for code quality, correctness, and efficiency


LangGraph Integration:

In this architecture we add individual agents as graph nodes and define the order in which agents are called ahead of time, in a custom workflow
Use state management for sharing code and feedback between agents
Implement proper error handling and recovery in the workflow
Consider human-in-the-loop capabilities for complex problems


Scalability Considerations:

Flexible device mapping: Supports various placement of models onto different sets of GPUs for efficient resource utilization and scalability across different cluster sizes
Design modular reward functions that can be easily extended
Use configuration files for easy experimentation with different models
Implement proper logging and monitoring for training runs


Common AI Assistant Misses:

Memory Management: VERL can be memory-intensive; implement proper batch sizing and gradient accumulation
Reward Function Design: Coding rewards need to balance correctness, efficiency, and style - don't just use pass@k
Agent Communication: Design clear interfaces between agents to avoid information loss
Training Stability: RL training can be unstable; implement proper checkpointing and recovery
Evaluation Metrics: Include diverse coding benchmarks beyond basic correctness



Recommended Starting Point:

Begin with a simple 3-agent system using LangGraph supervisor pattern
Implement basic VERL PPO training with synthetic coding problems
Use function-based rewards for code correctness verification
Gradually add complexity with multi-turn conversations and advanced RL algorithms
Scale up with larger models and more sophisticated reward functions

This framework provides a solid foundation for building a scalable, multi-agent coding system that can learn and improve through reinforcement learning while maintaining clear orchestration through LangGraph.
